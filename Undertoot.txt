05409: \E1* a small^1, white dog&  became president of&  the underground./
05410: \E0* it sleeps on the&  throne and does&  absolutely nothing./

05417: \E1* tell whoever made the&  game^1, okay?/
05418: \E2* they'll fix it^1, or&  if it's a novel&  situation.../

05425: \E1* I just called to tell&  you./
05426: \E0* I hate you./
05427: \E1* Yet..^1. strangely..^1.&* It's because of you^1,&  that.../
05428: \E2* That I was forced to&  become a better&  person./
05429: \E0* When I first saw you&  hurting people.../
05430: * I just sat there^1.&* Watching you./
05431: \E1* I felt so guilty knowing&  I hadn't do anything&  to stop you./
05432: \E3* I felt like all I&  do was.../
05433: \E4* Was hope you would&  destroy me^1, too./
05434: \E1* But when Undyne called^1,&  with crazed desperation&  in her voice.../
05435: \E0* I..^1.&* I realized I had to do&  something./
05436: \E1* Even if it meant&  everybody would.../
05437: * Have to learn the&  truth about me./
05438: \E2* It's strange^1.&* You know?/
05439: \E5* Even after all the&  bad things I did./
05440: * People treated me like&  a hero./
05441: \E2* And then they..^1.&* Asked me to run&  everything./
05442: \E5* So I'm trying my&  best^1, here./
05443: \E2* I think I have some&  good policies^1, but^1,&  y-you know.../

05445: \E0* I'm no ASGORE^1,&  you know?/
05446: \E4* God..^1.&* I miss everyone./
05447: \E3* Now that they're&  gone^1, it.../

05455: \E2* Sigh./

10256: \E0Hee hee hee.../
10257: Boy!/
10258: \E9Today's gonna be&just as fun./%%
10259: \E1I remember when I&first woke up here^1,&in the garden./
10260: I was so scared./
10261: \E2I couldn't feel my&arms or my legs.../
10262: \E1My entire body had&turned into a&flower!/
10263: \E5"Mom^1! Dad^1!&Somebody help me^1!"&I called out./
10264: \E9But nobody came./%%
10265: \E1Eventually^1, the king&found me^1, crying in&the garden./
10266: I explained what had&happened to him./
10267: Then he held me^1,&
10268: He held me with&tears in his eyes^1,&saying.../
10269: "There^1, there^1.&Everything is going&to be alright."/
10270: He was so..^1.&Emotional./
10271: \E1But..^1.&For some reason.../
10272: \E1I didn't feel&anything at all./%%
10273: \E1I soon realized I&didn't feel ANYTHING&about ANYONE./
10274: My compassion had&disappeared!/
10275: \E7And believe me^1,&it's not like I&wasn't trying./
10276: \E3I wasted weeks with&that stupid king^1,&vainly hoping I would&feel something./
10277: \E1But it became too&much for me./
10278: I ran away from&home./
10279: Eventually^1, I reached&the RUINS./
10280: \E0Inside I found HER^1,&
10281: I thought of all&people^1, SHE could&make me feel whole&again./
10282: \E7She failed./
10283: \E6Ha ha.../%%
10284: \E1I realized those two&were useless./
10285: I became despondent./
10286: I just wanted to&love someone./
10287: I just wanted to&care about someone./
10288: ^1, you might&not believe this.../
10289: \E2But I decided..^1.&It wasn't worth&living anymore./
10290: \E7Not in a world&without love./
10291: \E6Not in a world&without you./
10292: \E1So.../
10293: \E0I decided to follow&in your footsteps./
10294: \E1I would erase myself&from existence./
10295: \E1And you know what?/
10296: \E0I succeeded./%%
10297: \E1But as I left this&mortal coil.../
10298: I started to feel&apprehensive./
10299: \E9If you don't have&a SOUL^1, what happens&when you...?/
10300: \E1Something primal&started to burn&inside me./
10301: "No^1," I thought^1.&"I don't want to&die!"/
10302: Then I woke up./
10303: Like it was all&just a bad dream./
10304: I was back at the&garden./
10305: \E0Back at my&"save point."/%%
10306: Interested^1, I decided&to experiment./
10307: Again and again^1, I&brought myself to&the edge of death./
10308: At any point^1, I&could have let this&world continue on&without me./
10309: But as long as I&was determined to&live.../
10310: \E0I could go back./
10311: \E6Amazing^1, isn't it^1,&
10312: \E0I was amazed^1, too./%%
10313: \E1At first^1, I used my&powers for good./
10314: \E0I became "friends"&with everyone./
10315: I solved all their&problems flawlessly./
10316: Their companionship&was amusing.../
10317: \E1For a while. /
10318: \E1As time repeated^1,&people proved&themselves&predictable./
10319: What would this&person say if I&gave them this?/
10320: What would they do&if I said this to&them?/
10321: Once you know the&answer^1, that's it./
10322: That's all they are./%%
10323: \E1It all started&because I was&curious./
10324: \E0Curious what would&happen if I killed&them./
10325: \E2"I don't like this^1,"&I told myself./
10326: \E1"I'm just doing this&because I HAVE to&know what happens./
10327: \E8Ha ha ha..^1.&What an excuse!/
10328: \E9You of all people&must know how&liberating it is to&act this way./
10329: \E8At least we're better&than those sickos&that stand around and&WATCH it happen.../
10330: \E9Those pathetic people&that want to see it^1,&but are too weak to&do it themselves./
10331: \E0I bet someone like&that's watching right&now^1, aren't they...?/%%
10332: \E1Nowadays^1, even that's&grown tiring./
10333: \E7You understand^1,&
10334: \E6I've done everything&this world has to&offer./
10335: \E1I've read every book^1.&I've burned every&book./
10336: I've won every game^1.&I've lost every game./
10337: I've appeased&everyone^1.&I've killed everyone./
10338: Sets of numbers..^1.&Lines of dialogue..^1.&I've seen them all./
10339: \E1But you..^1.&YOU'RE different./
10340: \E0I never could&predict YOU^1, 
10341: \E1When I saw you in&the RUINS^1, I didn't&recognize you./
10342: \E8I thought I could&frighten you^1, then&steal your SOUL./
10343: \E1I failed./
10344: \E0And when I tried&to load my save&file.../
10345: \E1It didn't work./
10346: \E9
10347: ..^1.&Your DETERMINATION!/
10348: \E8Somehow^1, it's even&greater than mine!/%%

10350: How did you get&back to the RUINS&from here...?/
10351: \E0... wait^1, I know./
10352: She must have taken&you when she left./
10353: \E1And decided to give&you a proper burial^1,&rather than.../
10354: \E0Hanging out in the&basement forever./
10355: \E1... but^1, why then...?/
10356: What made you wake&up?/
10357: \E6Did you hear me&calling you...?/%%
10358: \E1It doesn't matter&now./
10359: \E1I'm so tired of&this^1, 
10360: I'm tired of all&these people./
10361: I'm tired of all&these places./

10365: Let's free everyone./

10367: \E6That despite it all.../
10368: \E9This world is still&"kill or be killed!!"/%%
10369: \E1Then...?/
10370: \E7Well^1.&I had.../

11581: * Frisk^1, when 
11582: &  and I combined our&  SOULs together.../
11583: * The control over our&  body was actually split&  between us./
11584: * They were the one&  that picked up their&  own empty body./
11585: * And then^1, when we&  got to the village.../
11586: \E2* They were the one&  that wanted to.../
11587: \E1* ... to use our full&  power./
11588: \E2* I was the one that&  resisted./
11589: \E7* And then^1, because of&  me^1, we.../
11590: \E1* Well^1, that's why I&  ended up a flower./
11591: * This whole time^1, I've&  blamed myself for&  that decision./
11592: * That's why I adopted&  that horrible view&  of the world./
11593: * "Kill or be killed."/
11594: \E7* But now..^1.&* After meeting you.../
11595: \E0* Frisk^1, I don't regret&  that decision anymore./
11596: \E4* I did the right&  thing./
11597: * If I killed those&  humans.../
11598: * We would have had to&  wage war against all&  of humanity./
11599: \E0* And in the end^1,&  everyone went free^1,&  right?/
11600: \E7* I still feel kind&  of sad knowing how&  long it took.../
11601: \E0* ... so maybe it&  wasn't a perfect&  decision./
11602: * But you can't regret&  hard choices your&  whole life^1, right?/
11603: \E7* Well^1, not that I&  have much of a life&  left./
11604: \E0* But that's besides&  the point./%%
11605: * Frisk^1, thank you&  for listening to me./

16410: * As I came in^1, I realized I&  forgot to make a reservation./

16430: * One thing I can say.../

16668: \E0* Long ago^1, ASGORE and I&  agreed that escaping would&  be pointless.../

16695: \E0* That emblem actually predates&  written history^1.&* The original meaning has been&  lost to time.../
16696: \E4* All we know is that the&  triangles symbolize us monsters&  below^1, and the winged circle&  above symbolizes.../
16697: \E3* Somethin' else./

16707: \E0* Folks kept saying "nice muu-&  muu" to her^1, but she kept&  thinking they were calling&  her a cow./
16708: \E1* So she never wore it again./
16709: \E3* What was the question again?/
16710: \E0* Oh^1.&* Right^1.&* ASGORE./
16711: \E3* He's a real interesting&  type of monster^1.&* The strongest type of all./
16712: \E0* We call 'em Boss Monsters./
16713: * When they have an offspring^1,&  the SOUL power of the&  parents flows into the&  child.../
16714: * Causing the child to grow&  as the parents age./
16715: \E3* But ASGORE doesn't have a&  child^1.&* So he's been stuck at the&  same age..^1.&* And probably will be forever./
16716: \E1* Huh^1?&* What if the child is a&  human...^1? What?/
16717: \E1* Nah^1. That wouldn't work^1.&* So if ASGORE's your father^1,&  he'll definitely outlive&  you./%%
16718: \E1* I've lived too long to&  be afraid of something&  like you./

16722: * King Fluffybuns^1?&* He's a friendly^1, happy-go-lucky&  kind of guy.../

16724: \E3* Eh^1?&* Why do I call Dreemurr&  'Fluffybuns?^1'&*\E2 Oh^1, that's a great story!/
16725: \E0* I don't remember it./

16727: \E2* Oh yeah^1!&* Of course^1.&* Toriel was queen^1, and&  Asgore was the king./
16728: \E3* It was tragic when she left./
16729: \E1* Since everyone knew she was&  really the brains behind the&  throne.../
16730: \E0* But it was also just a&  teensy^1, teensy bit relieving^1,&  you know?/
16731: \E3* Those two were really&  insufferable together..^1.&* Nuzzling noses^1, bein' all cute&  n' cuddly in public..^1.&* Embarrassing their children.../
16732: \E0* They were so sweet it&  made me SICK^1.&* Thank god those days are&  over!/%%
16733: \E3* Eh^1? Fight you?/
16734: \E1* Nah..^1. I'm not a hero^1.&* Never was./
16735: \E2* And b'sides..^1.&* These old bones aren't fit&  for fighting anyhoo./
16736: \E3* One attack from you^1, and&  then I'd... well.../
16737: \E2* At least by talking to&  you^1, I've bought enough time&  for some of them to escape./%%
16738: \E0* Undyne^1?&* Yeah^1, she's a local hero&  around here./
16739: \E4* Through grit and determination&  alone^1, she fought her way to&  the top of the Royal Guard./
16740: \E3* Actually^1, she just came through&  here asking about someone who&  looked just like you.../
16741: \E0* I'd watch your back^1, kid^1.&* And buy some items..^1.&* It might just save your hide^1!&* Wa ha ha!/%%
16742: \E0* Undyne^1.&* She's really come a long way&  since she was a little&  urchin./
16743: \E2* I used to be a hero myself^1,&  back in the old days^1.&* Gerson^1, the Hammer of Justice./
16744: \E3* When she was younger^1, Undyne&  would follow me around^1, to&  watch me beat up bad guys.../
16745: \E0* Sometimes she'd even try&  to help!/
16746: \E3* Though^1, most of the time&  the folks she attacked weren't&  bad guys^1.&* It'd be the mailman or&  something like that./
16747: \E2* Anyhoo^1, I appreciated it^1!&* Wah ha ha ha!!!/%%
16748: \E1* I'm not a hero./
16749: \E3* But I know there's someone&  out there./
16750: \E0* Someone who'll never give&  up trying to do the&  right thing^1, no matter&  what./
16751: \E4* There's no prophecy or&  legend 'bout anyone like&  that./
16752: \E3* It's just something I know&  is true./
16753: \E0* That someone like that&  will strike you down./%%

17035: \E3* And by that I mean I hate&  him so^1, so much./%%
17036: \E1* Evacuation^1?&* You're yanking my chain^1,&  little weirdo./
17037: \E3* So WHAT if everybody else&  left work?&* So WHAT if nobody's buying&  anything?/
17038: \E6* Par for the course^1,&  little weirdo^1.&* Par for the course./%%
17039: * I'm a goofy goober Yeah &  this errorr. message./%%
17040: \E6* Thank you^1, little buddy./%%
17041: \E5* They wanna hang out after&  work?/
17042: \E3* Ha^1! Ahahaha!^1! Yes!!^1!&* I won't let you down!!/
17043: \E6* Little buddy..^1. thank you./
17044: * You've brought a tear to the&  eye of this old man./
17045: \E5* So^1, uh^1, where do they&  want to go?/
17046: * They want to hang out at&  the garbage dump./
17047: \E6* Well^1, nowhere to go but&  up^1, right^1, little buddy?/%%
17048: \E5* Well^1?&* Don't keep me waiting^1,&  little buddy!!/%%
17049: \E4* The girls were..^1.&* Talking about me...?/
17050: * They say I should stop acting&  like they owe me.../
17051: \E5* ... and if I want to be&  FRIENDS with them^1, I should&  just..^1. uh^1, try to see&  things from their&  perspective?/
17052: \E4* Wow./
17053: \E6* Poor^1, naive little buddy^1.&* They've brainwashed you./
17054: * "Friendship" is just a hot&  person's way of making you&  their slave./
17055: \E5* So^1, uh^1, what time would&  they wanna hang out?/%%
17056: \E4* Everyone calls me burgerpants&  now./
17057: \E5* But you won't^1, will you^1,&  little buddy?/%%
17058: \E6* So I went out to the alley&  to see those two ladies^1, and&  uh..^1. you know^1, see what'd&  happen next./
17059: \E5* Then my boss^1, uh^1, saw me and&  asked me what I was doing./
17060: \E1* I was so startled^1, the hamburgers&  in my pockets tumbled out&  onto the ground./
17061: \E3* Not wanting to lose face^1,&  I scrambled to pick them up!/
17062: \E3* But^1, as I was leaning over^1,&  the weight of the remaining&  hamburgers.../
17063: \E5* ... caused my pants to fall&  down./
17064: \E4* Then the girls laughed at me./
17065: \E4* Everyone calls me Burgerpants&  now./%%
17066: \E6* Listen^1.&* I like you^1, little buddy^1.&* So I'm gonna save you a lot&  of trouble./
17067: \E3* Never interact with attractive&  people./
17068: \E6* Unless you're "one of them^1,"&  they're just gonna take&  advantage of you./
17069: \E3* Like that time those two&  chicks asked me to sneak them&  some glamburgers./
17070: \E6* And I^1, naive teenager that&  I was^1, said yes to them./
17071: \E4* Bad idea./%%
17072: \E4* Those girls?&* The ones who saw my pants&  fall down?/
17073: \E5* Well^1, we're all gonna be&  free^1, so I'll never see&  them again^1, at least!/%%
17074: \E4* So we're free now./
17075: \E5* Does that mean my double-&  date is cancelled...?/
17076: \E5* I know^1, it wasn't really&  a..^1.&* A date./
17077: \E6* Here's a trick^1, little buddy^1:&* Lie to yourself all the time^1.&* It makes you feel better./%%
17078: \E4* Well^1, Mettaton didn't tell me&  I HAD to work, I guess.../
17079: \E3* But that's the thing^1!&* Sometimes he doesn't even&  call me into work until&  halfway into my shift!/
17080: \E4* If I don't play it safe^1,&  he's going to yell at me./
17081: \E6* Okay^1, maybe "yell" is the&  wrong term./
17082: \E4* It's more like he has this..^1.&* CD album he plays.../
17083: \E5* That's entirely full of&  songs about how bad I am&  at my job./%%
17084: \E5* Let's not talk about this./%%
17085: \E1* Why do people find him so&  attractive??/
17086: \E3* He's literally just a freaking&  rectangle./
17087: * You know^1, one time^1, I bought&  one of those^1, uh^1, kits&  online..^1. to.../
17088: \E5* Uh^1, make yourself more&  rectangular./
17089: \E5* They don't work./%%
17090: \E3* God^1, have you even looked&  around^1?&* This place is a labyrinth of&  bad choices./
17091: * And every time we try to change&  something for the better^1, he&  vetoes it and says "that's not&  how they do it on the&  surface."/
17092: \E1Oh! Right!/
17093: \E3* Humans are always eating&  hamburgers made of SEQUINS&  AND GLUE./%%
17094: \E5* When I first came to Hotland^1,&  it was my dream to work&  with Mettaton./
17095: \E3* Well^1, be careful what you&  wish for^1, little buddy!/%%
17096: \E3* Don't tell anyone this^1, Little&  Buddy./
17097: \E4* (Because they'll make fun&  of me,)/
17098: \E5* But I..^1.&* I feel like I played a hand in&  everyone getting free&  somehow./
17099: \E1* Even if it was just&  working this awful job.../
17100: \E5* I think I did something!/
17101: \E3* I don't know if it's true^1,&  but I'll believe it anyway!/%%
17102: \E3* Huh?&* Everyone else is DEAD?/
17103: \E5* Does that mean I don't&  have to work today?/
17104: \E6* God^1.&* That it were true^1,&  little weirdo^1.&* That it were true./%%
17105: \E3* Future^1?&* WHAT future^1?&* Nothing down here EVER&  changes./
17106: \E4* I'll probably be trapped&  at this stupid job forever./
17107: \E3* But wait^1!&* There's one thing that keeps&  me going!/
17108: * If ASGORE gets just one&  more SOUL^1, we'll finally get&  to go to the surface!/
17109: * It'll be a brand new world^1!&* There's gotta be a second&  chance out there for me^1!&* For everyone!/
17110: \E6* So stay strong^1, little buddy^1.&* When I make it big^1, I'll&  keep you in mind./%%
17111: \E3* Little buddy^1!&* There's a brand new world&  out there waiting&  for us./
17112: \E6* I'm sure with my (ahem)&  qualifications^1, it won't&  be long before I'm a&  famous movie star.../
17113: \E4* Or^1, maybe I'll just end up&  flipping burgers again./
17114: \E3* But it's as I say^1!&* Nowhere to go but up^1!&* Literally^1, in this case!/%%
17115: \E6* Sorry^1, little weirdo^1.&* Threats won't work on me./
17116: * I can't go to hell^1.&* I'm all out of vacation&  days./%%
17117: \E0* I'm sorry^1, (Ha ha) it's against&  the rules to talk to customers&  who haven't bought anything./%%
17118: \E1* What^1?&* Why do you keep trying to talk&  to me?/
17119: \E1* I'll get in trouble if I get&  chummy with the customers./
17120: \E0* Sorry./
17121: \E3* SO^1, I wanted to be an ACTOR./%%

17377: * Where is he...^1?&* I can feel our political&  system crumbling apart.../%%
17378: * Awful teens tormented&  a local monster by decorating&  its tree-like horns./
17379: * So we started giving that&  monster presents to make it&  feel better./
17380: * Now it's a tradition to put&  presents underneath a decorated&  tree./%%
17381: * Guess it was a good thing&  those teens tormented that&  monster...?/%%
17382: * Hmm^1?&* Adjusting the presents is&  my responsibility./
17383: * Nah^1, to be honest^1, I&  just keep looking to see&  if I've gotten one.../%%
17384: * It'll be nice to show humans&  our presents-under-the-tree&  tradition./
17385: * They'll probably be weirded&  out by it./%%
17386: * You know what's cute?/
17387: * Those two married dogs&  always put presents under&  the tree for each other./
17388: * It's always the same^1.&* A single bone./
17389: * But every time^1, they act&  like it's the first time&  they've gotten it./
17390: * Then Papyrus comes to take&  his bones back./
17391: * Anyway^1, where are those&  two...?/%%
17392: * That's strange^1.&* There was a present here&  for Papyrus.../
17393: * Now it's gone^1.&* Did someone steal it?/%%
17394: * We all know the underground&  has problems^1, but we&  smile anyway./
17395: * Why?/
17396: * We can't do anything^1, so&  why be morose about it?/%%
17397: * Smile smile./%%
17398: * PATHETIC HUMAN./
17399: \W* I AM METTATON^2, BIG TIME&  \RSEXY ROBOT\W LOVER./%%
17400: * Maybe I'll try frowning&  for once./
17401: * ... no^1.&* I just can't do it./%%
17402: * Oh^1?&* We're free?/
17403: * Finally..^1.&* I'll be able to stop&  smiling./%%
17404: * Just now^1, I felt my smile&  falter for a moment./
17405: * What's wrong?/%%
17406: * Everyone is always laughing&  and cracking jokes^1, trying&  to forget our modern crises.../
17407: * Dreariness^1.&* Crowding^1.&* Lack of sunlight./
17408: * I would join them^1, but I'm&  just not very funny./%%
17409: * At least I'm not making puns./%%
17410: * Wait^1!&* I've got a joke!/
17411: * Knock knock!/
17412: * ... Uh^1.&* That's all I've thought of./%%
17413: * Looks like I don't have&  to worry about cracking&  jokes anymore./
17414: * I was going to say a joke&  here^1, but I really don't&  have one./%%
17415: * It just feels like..^1.&* Like everything is getting&  worse and worse./%%
17416: * The capital's getting pretty&  crowded^1, so I've heard they're&  going to start moving here./
17417: * Hmmm..^1.&* I don't want to see the&  erasure of our local culture./
17418: * But I definitely want to see&  some city slickers slip onto&  their butts!/%%
17419: * Yeah^1, bring 'em on!/%%
17420: * What will happen to&  Grillby's if everyone&  moves in...?/
17421: * We're gonna have to have&  chairs to the ceiling./%%
17422: * Hey^1! People won't have to&  move in from the city&  anymore!/
17423: * Seems like we won't have&  to lose our local culture./
17424: * ... except we're all moving&  out of here^1, huh./
17425: * Oh well^1. Guess it can't be&  all punk-peaches and punk-&  cream./%%
17426: * ... who knows^1.&* Maybe we'll have room./%%
17427: * Ah^1, to be young again^1.&* The world sure felt boundless./%%
17428: * You like to wander^1.&* You must be young./%%
17429: * Seems like this is the&  beginning of a brand-new^1,&  boundless world.../
17430: * Wah-ha^1!&* This adventurous spirit^1!&* I'm like a kid again!/
17431: * And my children are like..^1.&* Double-children./%%
17432: * I've sent the kids inside./
17433: * It feels unsafe here today./%%
17434: * Ice Wolf no longer has to&  throw Ice./
17435: * Ice Wolf can take a break to&  buy some pants now./%%
17436: * Ice Wolf thinking of changing&  their name to Jimmy Hotpants./%%
17437: * Let's play Monsters and Humans!/%%
17438: * Let's continue to play&  Monsters and Humans!/%%
17439: * Now we can play Monsters&  and Humans with REAL humans!/%%
17440: * You aren't gonna make me&  be the human again^1, are you?/%%
17441: * Can we PLEASE play something&  else...?/%%
17442: * Hmmm..^1.&* When humans play Monsters&  and Humans.../
17443: * Do they just call it&  Humans and Humans?/%%

17458: * C'mon Sansy^1!&* You're the life of the&  party.../%%
17459: * Those dogs are part of&  the ROYAL GUARD^1, the elite&  military group led by UNDYNE./
17460: * She's rude^1, loud^1, and beats up&  everybody who gets in her&  way.../
17461: * It's no wonder all the kids&  want to be like her when&  they grow up!/%%
17462: * I want to be like UNDYNE&  when I grow up^1, too^1!&* Hoo hoo hoo!/%%
17463: * Sans is a sentry^1.&* But don't let his title make&  you think he does anything./
17464: \W* Everyone knows he sits&  around in the forest&  reading \Ycar magazines\W./%%

17470: * I might not get to&  translate for Grillby&  anymore.../
17471: * ... which is fine^1, since I&  was actually just making&  up what he was saying./%%
17472: * Grillby is getting nervous./
17473: * Sans is his best customer^1,&  and he hasn't shown up&  at all today.../%%
17474: * Something feels really bad^1.&* Our lives are going nowhere^1,&  aren't they...?/
17475: * I think I need another&  espresso.../%%
17476: * ..^1.&* ..^1.&* ..^1./
17477: * Grillbz said that he'd offer&  you a glass of water^1, but he&  doesn't touch the stuff./%%
17478: * .............^1.&* ..............^1.&* ... good job./%%
17479: * Grillbz said that your&  food is probably cold&  by now./%%
17480: * I "put out a line" for some&  girls today./
17481: * Someone told me that there&  are plenty of fish in the&  sea.../
17482: * Well^1, I'm taking that&  seriously./
17483: * I'm literally going to make&  out with a fish./%%
17484: * I guess I could ask out Undyne^1.&* But I think she likes someone&  already./%%
17485: * Did I catch anyone yet^1?&* I can't bear to look.../%%
17486: * Sans is the most regular&  regular of all./
17487: * He hasn't been showing up&  as much recently though./%%
17488: * Where the heck is Sans?/

17490: * Though it was probably&  some kind of prank./
17491: * But I wanted to know what&  the prank was!/%%
17492: * In the end^1, I never caught&  any girls on my fishing&  line./
17493: * So kid^1, take it from me.../

17538: * Disgusting./
17539: * I'd love to try it sometime./%%
17540: * And I've heard they have&  things called bathrooms./%%
17541: * To a human^1, monster food&  would be very interesting./

17573: * She hasn't been responding&  to our letters.../

17593: * Sometimes the others like to&  prank me^1. They sit still&  so I can't see them./
17594: * They must be here^1, playing a&  joke on me./
17595: * I'll just wait until one of&  them admits it.../%%

18056: \E3* I think they smelled&  the potato chips you&  had^1, and.../
18057: \E3* Anyway!/
18058: \E6* The power went out^1,&  and I've been trying&  to turn it back on!/
18059: \E4* But it seems like you&  were one step ahead&  of me./

18061: \E4* B-but I appreciate&  that you came here&  to back me up!/

18063: \E8* Not come back.../
18064: \E5* But that's not because&  of these guys or&  anything!/
18065: \E4* I was just worried I&  would be too afraid.../

18067: \E8* That I might run away^1,&  or do something.../
18068: \E9* Cowardly./
18069: *\E8 Uh..^1. I..^1.&* I suppose I owe you&  an explanation./
18070: \E9* As you probably know^1,&  ASGORE asked me to study&  the nature of SOULs./
18071: \E3* During my research^1, I&  isolated a power I&  called "determination."/
18072: \E6* I injected it into dying&  monsters so their SOULs&  would last after death./
18073: \E9* But the experiment&  failed./
18074: * You see^1, unlike humans',&  monsters' bodies don't&  have enough.../
18075: * Physical matter to take&  those concentrations&  of "determination."/
18076: * Their bodies started to&  melt^1, and lost what&  physicality they had./
18077: \E3* Pretty soon^1, all of the&  test subjects had melted&  together into.../
18078: \E8* Those./
18079: \E9* Seeing them like this^1,&  I knew.../
18080: \E8* I couldn't tell their&  families about it./
18081: \E8* I couldn't tell anyone&  about it./
18082: \E9* No matter how much&  everyone was asking me./
18083: \E9* And I was too afraid to&  do any more work^1,&  knowing.../
18084: \E8* ... everything I'd done&  so far had been such&  a horrific failure./
18085: \E9* ... but now./
18086: \E9* Now^1, I've changed my&  mind about all this./
18087: \E9* I'm going to tell&  everyone what I've done./
18088: * It's going to be hard./
18089: * Being honest..^1.&* Believing in myself.../
18090: * I'm sure there will be&  times where I'll&  struggle./
18091: * I'm sure there will be&  times where I screw&  up again./
18092: \E0* But knowing^1, deep down^1,&  that I have friends&  to fall back on.../
18093: \E7* I know it'll be a&  lot easier to stand&  on my own./
